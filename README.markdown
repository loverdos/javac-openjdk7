### javac-openjdk7

These are just the javac sources from openjdk, repackaged using `openjdk7` as top-level package and with a simple `pom.xml` to build the jar file in an easy way.

The code comes from the _langtools_ of `openjdk7` but this is not a complete copy of the original tree contents. The intention is to have a standalone jar with the full `javac` machinery, as a stable reference point for research & fun.

The license and copyright are those coming from the original sources.
